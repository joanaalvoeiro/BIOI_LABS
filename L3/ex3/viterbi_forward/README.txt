The program ex3.py runs the Viterbi algorithm followed by the Forward algorithm on a nucleotide sequence input by the user.
It outputs the Pi* computed through the Viterbi algorithm, followed by the (states x sequence) matrix generated by the Forward
algorithm, and lastly the value for P(S) computed via the Forward algorithm.
Our program is dependent on the numpy library. To install numpy, please use the command 'pip install numpy'.
Our program is also dependent on the math library, which should come preinstalled with python.

To run:
- Open the terminal in the directory containing ex3.py
- Insert the command 'python3 ex3.py'
- You will then be prompted to insert the sequence to evaluate, please input a sequence composed of nucleotides A, T, C and G.

An example of interaction with our program would be:
($ indicates the command prompt, > indicates user input)

$ python3 ex3/ex3.py
Input the sequence: 
>atcg

Pi*: [1, 1, 2, 2]
